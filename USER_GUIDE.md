   - Examples: environment=production, team=backend, expires=2024-12-31

4. **Submit**
   - Click "Create Secret" to save
   - You'll be redirected to the secret detail page

#### Using the API

```bash
# Create a personal secret
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/secrets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "my-api-key",
    "value": "secret-value-here",

    "metadata": {
      "environment": "development",
      "created_by": "john_doe"
    }
  }'

# Create a role-based secret
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/secrets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "key": "database_password",
    "value": "super_secure_db_password",
    "secret_type": "role_based",
    "metadata": {
      "environment": "production",
      "database": "primary"
    }
  }'
```

### Viewing Secrets

#### Secret Detail Page (`/secrets/:key`)

Access by clicking on any secret in the dashboard or navigating to `/secrets/secret-key-name`.

**Information Displayed:**

### Editing Secrets

#### Process
1. **Navigate to Edit**: Click "Edit" on secret detail page or go to `/secrets/:key/edit`
2. **Modify Information**: 
   - Secret value (required for new version)
   - Metadata (optional)
   - Note: Secret key and type cannot be changed
3. **Version Creation**: Editing creates a new version automatically
4. **Submit Changes**: Save to create new version

#### Important Notes
- **No Pre-population**: For security, the edit form never shows the current secret value
- **Version Increment**: Each edit creates a new version
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with user and timestamp
- **Permission Check**: Edit permission required

### Version Management

#### Viewing Version History (`/secrets/:key/versions`)

**Information Shown:**
- Version number
- Creation timestamp
- User who created the version
- Metadata for that version

2. **Confirmation**: Confirm deletion in modal dialog
3. **Soft Delete**: Secret is marked as deleted but preserved for audit
4. **Immediate Effect**: Secret no longer appears in lists or searches

#### Important Notes
- **Soft Deletion**: Secrets are never permanently deleted
- **Audit Preservation**: Deletion is logged and secret remains in audit trail
- **Permission Required**: Delete permission needed
- **No Recovery**: Once deleted, secrets cannot be recovered through UI (admin action required)

## Role-Based Access Control

### Understanding RBAC in VaultLite

VaultLite uses a role-based access control system where:
- **Users** have **Roles**
- **Roles** have **Permissions**
- **Permissions** control access to **Secrets**

### Permission Types

#### Standard Permissions
- **read**: View secret values and metadata
- **write**: Create and update secrets
- **delete**: Remove secrets
- **admin**: Full administrative access

#### Permission Scope
- **Personal Secrets**: Automatically accessible only by owner
- **Role-based Secrets**: Access controlled by role permissions
- **Path Patterns**: Permissions can be scoped to specific secret patterns

### For Regular Users

#### Viewing Your Roles
- **Location**: Profile section or dashboard sidebar
- **Information**: Shows assigned roles and their permissions
- **Access**: Read-only for regular users

#### Understanding Access
- **Green Badge**: You have access to this secret
- **Red Badge**: Access denied
- **Permission Required**: Specific action not allowed

### For Admins

#### User Management (`/admin/users`)

**Functions Available:**
- View all users in the system
- Search and filter users
- Assign roles to users
- Create new user accounts
- Activate/deactivate users
- View user activity

- **Environment Separation**: Separate roles for dev/staging/production access

#### Common Role Examples
```
Viewer Role:
- Permissions: read
- Use: Developers who need to read production configs

Developer Role:
- Permissions: read, write
- Use: Team members who manage development secrets

Operations Role:

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Authentication Problems

**Issue**: Cannot login with correct credentials
```
Symptoms: Login form shows "Invalid credentials" despite correct password
Possible Causes:
- Account deactivated by admin
- Password recently changed
- Database connection issues
- JWT secret misconfiguration

Solutions:
1. Verify account is active (contact admin)
2. Try password reset if available
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
```

**Issue**: JWT token expired or invalid
```
Symptoms: API calls return 401 Unauthorized
Solutions:
1. Re-authenticate to get new token
2. Check token expiration time
3. Verify token format and integrity
4. Ensure proper Authorization header format
```

#### Permission and Access Issues

**Issue**: Cannot access expected secrets
```
Symptoms: Secrets not visible in dashboard or API returns 403 Forbidden
Diagnosis:
1. Check your assigned roles: Profile ‚Üí Roles
2. Verify secret type (personal vs role-based)
3. Contact admin for permission review

Solutions:
1. Request appropriate role assignment from admin
2. Verify you're the owner (for personal secrets)
3. Check secret key spelling and case sensitivity
```

**Issue**: Cannot perform actions (create, edit, delete)
```
Symptoms: Action buttons disabled or API returns permission errors
Solutions:
1. Verify you have write/delete permissions
2. Check if secret is soft-deleted
3. Ensure proper role assignment
4. Contact admin for permission escalation
```

#### Interface and Navigation Issues

**Issue**: Dashboard not loading or showing errors
```
Symptoms: Blank dashboard, loading errors, or error messages
Solutions:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Try different browser or incognito mode
5. Check network connectivity
```

**Issue**: Real-time updates not working
```
Symptoms: Changes from other users not appearing automatically
Solutions:
1. Check WebSocket connection (browser developer tools)
2. Refresh page manually
3. Check for proxy/firewall blocking WebSocket connections
4. Verify Phoenix LiveView configuration
```

#### Secret Management Issues

**Issue**: Cannot create secrets
```
Symptoms: Create form shows validation errors or submission fails
Common Validations:
- Secret key: 1-255 characters, unique
- Secret value: Maximum 1MB size
- Metadata: Maximum 10KB, valid JSON structure

Solutions:
1. Check key uniqueness
2. Reduce secret value size
3. Validate metadata format
4. Ensure proper permissions
```

**Issue**: Secrets not appearing in search
```
Symptoms: Created secrets don't show in dashboard or search results
Solutions:
1. Check search filters (All/Personal/Role-based)
2. Verify secret type matches filter
3. Check if secret was soft-deleted
4. Refresh the page
5. Verify you have read permissions
```

#### API Issues

**Issue**: API calls failing with 429 Rate Limited
```
Symptoms: Too many requests error
Solutions:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Reduce request frequency
3. Check rate limit headers
4. Contact admin if limits too restrictive
```

**Issue**: API responses showing HTML instead of JSON
```
Symptoms: Unexpected HTML content in API responses
Causes:
- Incorrect endpoint URL
- Server error redirecting to error page
- CSRF token issues

Solutions:
1. Verify correct API endpoint URLs
2. Include proper Content-Type headers
3. Check for server errors in logs
4. Ensure proper authentication
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Dashboard Loading
```
Symptoms: Dashboard takes long time to load
Solutions:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Reduce number of secrets (use pagination)
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check server performance/load
```

#### Slow Secret Operations
```
Symptoms: Create/edit/delete operations are slow
Solutions:
1. Reduce secret value size
2. Minimize metadata
3. Check database performance
4. Verify encryption performance
```
